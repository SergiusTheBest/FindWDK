# Introduction

FindWDK makes it possible to build kernel drivers and kernel libraries with Windows Development Kit (WDK) and CMake.

Requirements:

- WDK 8.0 and higher
- Visual Studio 2015 and higher
- CMake 3.0 and higher

## Build

Though no source is in this installation, a simple CMakeLists.txt was included to allow installation of packages. Simply "build and install" like you would any other package.

```powershell
mkdir build-out
cd build-out
cmake ..
MSBuild.exe FindWDK.sln
```

Didn't really need the build step, but thought it would be uniform.

## Install

Then from a administrator command prompt:

```powershell
MSBuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj
```

You can find the files in `C:/Program Files (x86)/FindWDK`.

# Usage

If you installed the package in the above step, you just need to call `find_package` on it.

```cmake
find_package(FindWDK)
```

Then add the `INCLUDE_DIR` path to your `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`:

```cmake
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${FindWDK_INCLUDE_DIR})
find_package(WDK REQUIRED)
```

## Optional Usage

You may add `FindWDK` to the module search path and call `find_package`. if you did not perform the build and install. You can then replace `${FindWDK_INCLUDE_DIR}` with  `"<path_to_FindWDK>"` being the local path of FindWDK on your system.

## FindWDK Output Variables

FindWDK will search for the latest installed Windows Development Kit (WDK) and expose commands for creating kernel drivers and kernel libraries. Also the following variables will be defined:

- `WDK_FOUND` -- if false, do not try to use WDK
- `WDK_ROOT` -- where WDK is installed
- `WDK_VERSION` -- the version of the selected WDK
- `WDK_WINVER` -- the WINVER used for kernel drivers and libraries (default value is `0x0601` and can be changed per target or globally)
- `WDK_NTDDI_VERSION` -- the NTDDI_VERSION used for kernel drivers and libraries, if not set, the value will be automatically calculated by WINVER

`WDKContentRoot` environment variable overrides the default WDK search path.

## Kernel driver

The following command adds a kernel driver target called `<name>` to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation:

```cmake
wdk_add_driver(<name> 
    [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
    [KMDF <kmdf_version>]
    [WINVER <winver_version>]
    [NTDDI_VERSION <ntddi_version>]
    source1 [source2 ...]
    )
```

Options:

- `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` -- exclude from the default build target
- `KMDF <kmdf_version>` -- use KMDF and set KMDF version
- `WINVER <winver_version>` -- use specific WINVER version
- `NTDDI_VERSION <ntddi_version>` -- use specific NTDDI_VERSION

Example:

```cmake
wdk_add_driver(KmdfCppDriver 
    KMDF 1.15 
    WINVER 0x0602
    Main.cpp
    )
```

## Kernel library

The following command adds a kernel library target called `<name>` to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation:

```cmake
wdk_add_library(<name> [STATIC | SHARED]
    [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
    [KMDF <kmdf_version>]
    [WINVER <winver_version>]
    [NTDDI_VERSION <ntddi_version>]
    source1 [source2 ...]
    )
```

Options:

- `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` -- exclude from the default build target
- `KMDF <kmdf_version>` -- use KMDF and set KMDF version
- `WINVER <winver_version>` -- use specific WINVER version
- `NTDDI_VERSION <ntddi_version>` -- use specific NTDDI_VERSION
- `STATIC or SHARED` -- specify the type of library to be created

Example:

```cmake
wdk_add_library(KmdfCppLib STATIC 
    KMDF 1.15
    WINVER 0x0602
    KmdfCppLib.h 
    KmdfCppLib.cpp
    )
```

## Linking to WDK libraries

FindWDK creates imported targets for all WDK libraries. The naming pattern is `WDK::<UPPERCASED_LIBNAME>`. Linking a minifilter driver to `FltMgr.lib` is shown below:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(MinifilterCppDriver WDK::FLTMGR)
```

# Samples

Take a look at the [samples](samples) folder to see how WMD and KMDF drivers and libraries are built.
